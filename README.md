# BetterBags: Gear Sets
An extension for the [BetterBags](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/better-bags) WoW addon, to categorize all items that are a part of an equipment set, into a single category named "Gear Sets".

Supports multiple game locales, including English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish.

If you prefer to have multiple categories—one for each equipment set—BetterBags offers this functionality natively by enabling the "Gear Set" category option.

**Note**: There is a similar plugin originally authored by @RyciaSoulblight. After discovering issues with the plugin, I reached out with improvements and fixes, while also suggesting the project be moved to GitHub for easier community collaboration. Unfortunately, the author was unresponsive. After publishing this improved version, they quickly proceeded to copy-paste my code, claiming it as their own. I believe in collaboration and honesty, and while I'm glad my code improvements were found useful and welcome them to continue using any code I publish, it's disappointing to see efforts meant to help the community be co-opted in the manner they were.
